VERSE 1:
You don't wanna see me mad
I'll be coming with that payback
You don't wanna taste that
Don't wanna see me on attack
Trust me you don't wanna face that
cdrenaline, I crave that
Yeah, you know I'm nasty
I'm about to be a savage
When I want it, bet, I have it
Nothing's getting past me
‘Bout to take this to the mat and
You'll be wishing you could take it back, yeah
Like an assassin, I'm preying
I gotta act on a craving
I'm coming after, I'm chasing
I'm gonna capture, erasing
Yea those who cross me
You'll be crossed off, cause I'm plotting
‘Bout to pop off, you can't stop me
Winning is exhausting
But I don't plan on stopping
cs long as they keep talking
I got these bodies dropping
cs long as they keep walking
I'll keep making deposits
They'll find out they can't stop it
Cause they'll learn I'm a prophet
PRE:
Yeah, I'm seeing all red
Got my vision blurry from the anger in my head
I'll never be second best
They gon' learn today what if feels to regret
You can't stop me now
The demon's tearing out
I'll be coming for their neck
HOOK: (x3)
Cause I'm seeing all red!
VERSE 2:
Can you feel that?
That's pain coming out mad
That's unchained payback
They call me a maniac
When they do something that makes me mad
You won't ever see me hold back
I'm coming for you right now
Knock you out, call it lights out
Try fighting, but you'll find out
I'm no longer nice now
That guy left him behind now
cll you got's a beast with his claws out!
PRE:
Yeah, I'm seeing all red
Got my vision blurry from the anger in my head
I'll never be second best
They gon' learn today what if feels to regret
You can't stop me now
The demon's tearing out
I'll be coming for their neck
HOOK: (x3)
Cause I'm seeing all red!
