And they want smoke, we gon' bring the torch
We gon' bring the fire, put a beam in the sky
And these racks on me, poking out my thighs
And that Glock on me, hanging out my side
Just ride with me, till the very end
Would you die for me? 'Cause, for you, you know I would
All these hundreds on me, but I'm steady tryna spend them
Got a hundred clip, Calico tryna hit 'em
Got Hunned with me, that's my brother since the beginning
Got Hunned with me, that's my brother since eighth grade
I'm smoking on kush pack, this shit it got me lazy
I gotta go hard for my momma, put a smile on her face

War time, war zone
Bitch, I'm always outta time
I'm on whatever you on
Don't play with my shawty, you gon' get gone
Ain't playing with my shawty, you gon' get blown
We taking this shit to the grave, you already know
Fifty in my pocket, fifty the clip
Twin Glocks on me for my gang
I'm in the coupé, smoking on boof
Thinking about how things ain't change
Keep it together, out the mud
Put them rude boys on ya head
Baby bottles red, that's why they call it infrared
And all these faces in my pocket but they all dead
K.T.S. the whole scene, I leave 'em all dead
Free my blood up out the cage, put 'em in all red
If I see a red light, I'm gon' go

And if they want smoke, we gon' bring the torch
We gon' bring the fire, put a beam in the sky
And these racks on me, poking out my thighs
And that Glock on me, hanging out my side
Just ride with me, till the very end
Would you die for me? 'Cause, for you, you know I would
All these hundreds on me, but I'm steady tryna spend them
Got a hundred clip, Calico tryna hit 'em
Got Hunned with me, that's my brother since the beginning
Got Hunned with me, that's my brother since eighth grade
I'm smoking on kush pack, this shit it got me lazy
I gotta go hard for my momma, put a smile on her face
